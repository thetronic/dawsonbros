## BRIAN’S STORY ##
|SEQ03|

Good evening people of TOWN! 
Thank you for joining me for my business seminar ‘The Call of Now’.

By the end of this evening you will all have earnt a university-approved qualification. The university it is approved by is - the Butterfield University.

<AV: BUTTERFIELD UNIVERSITY LOGO>

Established 1832.
Or, for those unfamiliar with the 24 hour clock, 6:32pm.

<AV: 6.32>

I’m proud to say that, since just after half six, we’ve already reached number eight in the Sunday Times’s ‘Top 200 Universities’ - when ranked in alphabetical order.

This is a rigorous course, so at random moments during the seminar I will be randomly selecting one of you to answer a randomised business quiz question. A.K.A. Buiz Quiz.

<AV: BUIZ QUIZ>

I could ask a Buiz Quiz question to any one of you. 
So try your best not to fall asleep. And to the handful of you I can see are already asleep, please absorb this information subliminally.

It’ll all be worth it. After this seminar you’ll have earnt the one business qualification that money can’t buy!

However! You can buy it with money. 
Because pre-signed graduation certificates are available at the merch table.
“Merch” is short for merchandise - unfortunately we have run out of dice. So it’s just merch.

<AV: CALL OF NOW>

And you are all particularly lucky tonight: I don’t want to give too much away but, as a special surprise, I will be LAUNCHING my new business!


The COUNTDOWN has begun.
And it’s going to be OUT OF THIS WORLD.
Wink. I’ve already said too much.

More later about my secret rocket.

But first, let me tell you a little bit more about myself.


My name is Brian Butterfield - businessman, entrepreneur, business ... man.


But I wasn’t always the success you see standing before you today.

So, how did I get here? 

[SLIDE: BABY]
<AV: GFX: Picture of a Brian as a baby with a moustache>

Like a lot of people, I started life as a baby.
But that didn’t prevent me from trying to open my first business.

[SLIDE: BANK]
<AV: GFX: Brian as a baby sat opposite a bank manager>

However, the fact I was too young to open a business bank account - or talk - did stop me from opening my first business. 

But over time, like many of you, I became older.
And finally, I did open my first business...

[SLIDE: ASBESTOS]
<AV: GFX: A shop with the sign Butterfield’s Asbestos “we’re the asBESTos in the business!”>

...installing asbestos in hospitals. 

Unfortunately, it launched the day before asbestos was controversially banned from construction use. Not one to be deterred, I started my second business...

[SLIDE: REMOVAL]
<AV: GFX: Same picture of the shop but with REMOVAL crammed into the signage.>

...an asbestos removal company, but that was shut down due to the staff getting sick with - you’ve guessed it - lead poisoning.

But then I came up with a new business idea: the Brian Butterfield Sushi Sauna.

[SLIDE: SAUNA]
<AV: GFX: Sushi Sauna>

That pioneering culinary business was awarded three Michelin black holes...
[SLIDE: MICHELIN BLACK HOLES]
<AV: GFX: Brian receiving his certificate from a chef>

...unfortunately making it the worst restaurant in the universe.

But I pivoted to my next business - Butterfield’s Walk Around Safari Park...

[SLIDE: SAFARI]
<AV: GFX: The Butterfield Walk-A-Round Safari Park>

...for people who love animals - but don’t own a car. 

Luck was finally on my side.
Bad luck.

As the route round the park was 25 miles, it left people exhausted, dehydrated and vulnerable to animal attack - leading to countless lawsuits.


But then, suddenly, a lightbulb went off!

[SLIDE: BILL]
<AV: GFX: An unpaid electricity bill>

Because I hadn’t paid my electricity bill. But it gave me an idea! Butterfield’s Dark Bulbs!

[SLIDE: BULB]
<AV: GFX: A light bulb painted black>

For rooms that are too bright!

Due to each bulb requiring 15,000 megawatts to darken a room, climate change protesters soon put paid to that idea. But when one door closes, a window opens.

[SLIDE: WINDOW]
<AV: GFX: Newspaper headline “Idiot Falls Out of 15 Storey Window”>

Which I unfortunately fell out of.
Thankfully, I only suffered major injuries.
And during my convalescence I came up with a new business: Butt 365.

[SLIDE: BUTT365]
<AV: GFX: Butt 365 logo>

The only gambling website where the house loses. Guaranteed!

And after that business venture, I was really cooking on gas!
Specifically, one of those little gas stoves…


[SLIDE: STOVE]
<AV: GFX: Brian camping & cooking on a gas stove>

...as I was having to live in a tent.

But then my wildest dreams came true...

[SLIDE: DOGS]
<AV: GFX: Brian being attacked by a pack of dogs>

The dreams where I’m savaged by a pack of Bully XLs.
They ripped my suit to shreds.

But I bought a new suit on the way here, as you can see, and that brings everyone right up to date!

<AV: GFX: Splash Screen>

Which reminds me - I need to give myself a tetanus shot.

[DRINK SHOT]

This is a mix of ginger, apple juice and tetanus.

Now. 
By the end of this seminar, all of you will have the knowledge and tools to grow your business, achieve your goals and have a life like mine.

Fitting my lifetime's knowledge into an hour and a half seminar might seem impossible - but somehow I manage it. Often with time to spare. Last night’s seminar only lasted eleven minutes - and that included the interval.

But why should you listen to me?

Well, here are just a handful of the multinational organisations I have advised...

[SLIDE: COMPANIES]
<AV: GFX: PAST COMPANIES>

I helped to move all these companies in a new direction. 
<AV: GFX: Splash Screen>
## INTRO SEMINAR ##
|SEQ04|

But I know what you’re wondering: do my seminars get results? Well don’t ask me - ask my previous attendees...

[TALKING HEAD 1]
<AV: TALKING HEAD 1 (ON SCREEN): I signed up for a seminar called ‘The Importance of Detail’. But he put the wrong address on the poster.>

That is true. As I told the empty theatre again and again, we should all learn from our mistakes. Fun fact - I learnt there’s also a Birmingham in America.

[TALKING HEAD 2]
<AV: TALKING HEAD 2 (ON SCREEN): He cried in the middle of the presentation. The seminar was supposed to be about “Confidence”. How is that “confident”?>

It actually takes a lot of confidence to cry in front of 200 people. And in my defence it was the same day Zayn left One Direction. That wasn’t the reason I was crying - it just happened to be that day.

[TALKING HEAD 3]
<AV: TALKING HEAD 3 (ON SCREEN): He was talking about the importance of data protection. But at the end, instead of handing out business cards, he handed out his own bank cards.>

Correct again! Fortunately, no money was stolen because each card had already reached its overdraft limit ... and that was because I’d accidentally read out my account details earlier in the seminar.

[TALKING HEAD 4]
<AV: TALKING HEAD 4 (ON SCREEN): He said you have to dress to impress ... but he’d forgotten his trousers.>

Well, I can’t remember everything. I’m a busy man. That’s why I now wear two pairs of trousers ... oh, where’s my second pair?

[TALKING HEAD 5]
<AV: TALKING HEAD 5 (ON SCREEN): While he was talking about the importance of keeping your business at the forefront of technology ... he kept getting interrupted by his pager.>

Well that wasn’t a pager, for your information. That was a Tamagotchi. Who, shortly afterwards, sadly died ... at the age of 27. Rest in peace Kikitchi. I remember it well - it was the day Zayn left One Direction.


Although the reason he left One Direction was unrelated. As far as I know.

[STING]

So there you have it. What a wide-ranging mix of reviews. Although I must be honest - I did cherry-pick the best ones.

On this course I will be teaching you many things I have learnt over the years. But one principle underpins them all...

[SLIDE: PERSISTENCE]
<AV: GFX: “PERSISTENCE”>

Persinstence.

Sorry.

[MORE ATTEMPTS]
Per...sist..trunce.

Bear with me - it’s important I get this right.

[MORE ATTEMPTS]
Pepper-mint-stance.

The Simpsons.

P-E-R-S-I-S-T-E-N-NON KICKING “CUH”-E

[SIT DOWN]



Persistence.

I got it!

And that just goes to show the power of perminstance.
## THE FIVE B’S ##
|SEQ05|

Now, I don’t believe there’s such a thing as failure. 
Because I see each failure as a lesson learnt. 
Which means I’ve learnt at least 1,400 lessons - and counting.


I can’t teach you all of those lessons tonight because:

a) we don’t have enough time, and


b) I have forgotten most of them. I think it’s me trying to psychologically protect myself.


However, I have boiled down the ones I can remember to five key - easy-to-remember - business principles that I call ... “The Five B’s”. Here are the Five B’s.

<AV: GFX: 5B - INVENTION>

Invention

<AV: GFX: 5B - NETWORKING>

Networking

<AV: GFX: 5B - ADAPTABILITY>

Adaptability

<AV: GFX: 5B - RESILIENCE>

Resilience
And

<AV: GFX: 5B - BEE POSITIVE>

Be Positive


How do you remember this list? Simple. All you have to do is associate the type of bee with the relevant principle:


<AV: GFX: 5B - BUMBLE>

BUMBLE - because bumblebees have wings, just like the Wright brothers’ first plane. Which was an ... INVENTION.

<AV: GFX: 5B - HONEY>

HONEY - because honeybees live in a hive, where they like to ... NETWORKING.

<AV: GFX: 5B - DRONE>

DRONE - because a mechanical drone can be used as a fun children’s toy that you fly around the garden or as a lethal killing machine to drop bombs on enemy targets. Which demonstrates ... ADAPTABILITY

<AV: GFX: 5B - QUEEN>

QUEEN - because Queen Elizabeth the Second, God rest her soul, was married to Prince Philip for 73 years which shows she had a great deal of ... RESILIENCE.

<AV: GFX: 5B - HABROPODA PALLIDA>

And, of course, the final Bee: HABROPODA PALLIDA. Because HABROPODA PALLIDA is the happiest of the bees. So will always ... BE POSITIVE.

It couldn’t bee simpler.

However, some people have fed back to me that they find it difficult to remember the name ‘Habropoda pallida’.


So, for those people, I’ve come up with this simple mnemonic:


<AV: GFX: HABROPODA PALLIDA ACRONYM>

Harold
Always
Brings
Rotten
Oranges
Past
Other
Dirty
Apples

Space

Pedro
Adores
Lovely
Lollies
In
Diana’s
Attic

It’s that simple.

And if you are more of a visual learner then this image may help...

<AV: GFX: HARRY STYLES>

It’s Harry Styles bringing rotten oranges past dirty apples.


<AV: GFX: SPACE>


Space.

<AV: GFX: PEDRO & DIANA>

Pedro Pascal eating a lovely lolly in Diana’s Attic. That is of course one of the last photos taken of Lady Diana. And it’s from Pedro Pascal’s private collection.

Which gets you to Habropoda Pallida - which is the happiest of the bees - Bee Positive.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Brian?”, “Yes?”, “What if I forget that your system is called ‘The Five B’s’?”, “Good question!”, “Thank you.”

Well I’ve got an easy way to memorise that too: simply think of “The Five T’s”.

<AV: GFX: FIVE CUPS OF TEA>

Oolong
Mint
Earl Grey
Chamomile
Russian Caravan

Then you just have to associate each of those varieties of tea with the words...

Brian
Butterfield’s
Brilliant
Business
Blan

<AV: GFX: THE WORDS APPEAR ON EACH CUP OF TEA>

The word on each tea begins with a B - which gets you to “The Five B’s.” And, as we all know by now, the five bees are:

Be Positive
Resilience
Invention
Adaptability
Networking

<AV: GFX: THESE APPEAR ON BEES ON A SLIDE>

Oh.
I’ve just noticed.
The first letters of those words spell “Brian”. 

It’s such a shame they’re not in that order.

<AV: GFX: THE WORDS SHIFT BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE>
## ADAPTABILITY - CAREER ADVICE ##
|SEQ06|

Now, let’s begin with...

<AV: BUIZ QUIZ>

Ooh! A Buiz Quiz.


[CHOOSE PUNTER]

You! Shout your name.

[PUNTER BANTER]

Well. I hope you’ve been making copious revision notes, because your Buiz Quiz business quiz question is...

In the second section of the seminar - “The Five B’s” - what was the third ‘B’ that was actually the fourth ‘B’ that came one after the second ‘B’?

[PUNTER ANSWERS]

That’s incorrect. Which means, I’m afraid [NAME] that you will have to resit this entire seminar next year. Commiserations.

Normally I’d ask you to leave at this point, but I’ve taken pity on you so will let you stay.

And the rest of you, don’t be too smug because the next Buiz Quiz could happen at any moment.

[PAUSE]


Oh. I really thought there might have been one there. Never mind. Back to the seminar. Let’s get on with the first bee, which is the third bee: Adaptability.

<AV: GFX: INTRO FOR “ADAPTABILITY”>

[STING]

Urgh! Where’s the defibrillator... 

...actually, it's only got enough batteries for one more shock. I'll save it for a more major heart attack.

One of the most powerful adaptabilities you can make is to change your career.

And that’s what we’re going to do tonight for some of you - with the help of my smart assistant Bri-A-I-an.

<AV: GFX: BRI-A-I-AN CHIME>

Bri-A-I-an - say hello to everyone.

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: Hello>

BRI-A-I-AN: HELLO.

Or the worse. I’m legally required to say that.

Bri-A-I-an has been encoded with a state-of-the-art careers algorithm to help find you your perfect job.


I must be honest, I actually don’t know what an algorithm is. Bri-A-I-an? 

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN CHIME>

What is an algorithm?

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: An “algorithm” is a drumbeat played by Al Gore.>

BRI-A-I-AN: AN “ALGORITHM” IS A DRUMBEAT PLAYED BY AL GORE.

Fascinating. I did not know that.

So let’s change someone’s life. Who here is looking for a career change? Please raise your hand.

<LX: (8) AUDIENCE LIGHTS: UP>

[PICK AUDIENCE MEMBER]

Yes you. Now Bri-A-I-an is here to help you find your perfect career. What’s your name?

[RESPONSE]

I knew someone called NAME once. You’re not related are you?

[RESPONSE]

And what job do you currently do?

[RESPONSE]

To help the algorithm, please answer this question:
what’s your favourite number, between nought and one?

[RESPONSE]

Same as me! 
And that one piece of datum is all that the algorithm needs.
Bri-A-I-an? 

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN LISTENING>

Please give career advice.

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: I advise that you avoid visiting Korea between June and August as this is the monsoon season.>

BRI-A-I-AN: I ADVISE THAT YOU AVOID VISITING KOREA BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST AS THIS IS THE MONSOON SEASON.

No. Not Korea. Career.
As in - what is the best career for someone.

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: The best Korea for those who enjoy tyrannical governments is North Korea.>

BRI-A-I-AN: THE BEST KOREA FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENTS IS NORTH KOREA.

No. Let me rephrase it. Bri-A-I-an - what role would you recommend?

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: For this person, I would recommend a sausage roll.>

BRI-A-I-AN: FOR THIS PERSON, I WOULD RECOMMEND A SAUSAGE ROLL.

No. Not that kind of roll! OK. Try again.
Bri-A-I-an. What would be the best role for their career?

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: The most popular roll in Korea is a kimbap sushi roll.>

BRI-A-I-AN: THE MOST POPULAR ROLL IN KOREA IS A KIMBAP SUSHI ROLL.

No. Bri-A-I-an please suggest an ideal occupation or career.

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: The first occupation of Korea was in 1592 by the Japanese...>

BRI-A-I-AN: THE FIRST OCCUPATION OF KOREA WAS IN 1592 BY THE JAPANESE...

No. What is the perfect job for this person?

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: Web Designer. For spiders.>

BRI-A-I-AN: WEB DESIGNER. FOR SPIDERS.

That’s decided then.
Thank you NAME and congratulations on your new career.

Who else would like advice from Bri-A-I-an?

[PICK AUDIENCE MEMBER]

You. What is your name?

[RESPONSE]

OK, and what job do you do?

[RESPONSE]

[RESPONSE]

Thank you.
So. Bri-A-I-an. 

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN LISTENING>

What is their ideal job?

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: Lord Mayor’s Croupier.>

BRI-A-I-AN: LORD MAYOR’S CROUPIER.

Ah yes. The oldest profession. 
OK, we have time for one more person. Who’s next?

[PICK AUDIENCE MEMBER]

You. And your name is?

[RESPONSE]

And your current job?

[RESPONSE]

And if you could have any superpower, which would it be -
America, Russia or China?

[RESPONSE]


Strong choice.
So Bri-A-I-an.

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN LISTENING>

We have NAME. What job do you recommend?

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: Children’s Bounty Hunter.>

BRI-A-I-AN: CHILDREN’S BOUNTY HUNTER.

I should clarify - as a Children’s Bounty Hunter, you won’t be hunting the children. You will be employed BY the children to hunt and abduct the adult target of their choosing.

Well, thank you Bri-A-I-an. 

<LX: (8) AUDIENCE LIGHTS: OFF>

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN STOP>

To everyone who has been assigned a new career, Bri-A-I-an has made your transition easier by emailing your current employer on your behalf - with an A.I. generated letter of resignation.

[SHAKE OWN HANDS]

Thanks me!
I’m welcome.

Let’s move onto the second bee: Networking.

<AV: GFX: INTRO FOR “NETWORKING”>


I recently used my networking skills to secure a business lunch with Sir Richard Branson. Yes, that’s right - the man behind Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records - and the business that kicked it all off: Virgin Olive Oil.

But for many of you, the most important part of networking will be impressing potential employers in interviews.

Interviews can be intimidating. You have to be prepared for tough questions like...
“Brian - where are your shoes?”
“Brian - why are the edges of your CV burnt?”
“Brian - you do know there isn’t a university called ‘Oxbridge’?”
Oh really?! 
Well in that case - where did I spend three years doing my degree?

Over time, I’ve built a wealth of interview experience. The best way to impart my foolproof techniques is to demonstrate them - through role-play. So. Can I have a volunteer?

[NEGATIVE RESPONSE]

Oh. You probably shouldn’t have volunteered. Nevertheless, in this role-play, you will be rolling the play of ‘Interviewer’. 
The company you’re interviewing for is the Chinese tech giant: Huawei.

I have always been an admirer of your organisation, and I believe I’m well-equipped to help move you to the next level. 
And also, I’m heavily in debt.
Next question please.


[VOLUNTEER READS CARD]
{CARD: Sorry. How rude of me. I should have asked earlier - would you like a tea or a coffee?}


Ooh, yes please. 
I’ll have a decaf caramel macchiato. 
With just a splash of tea.

[VOLUNTEER READS CARD]
{CARD: There’s a bit of a gap here on your CV - can you explain it?}

<LX: (8) AUDIENCE LIGHTS: OFF>

Please tread lightly - the stage is made of balsa wood.

Allow me to set the scene: we are now in the opulent lobby of the Chinese tech giant: Huawei.

[ADDRESS VOLUNTEERS]

You are the C.E.O..

You are their assistant.

You are the Head of Human Resources.

You are the Head of Finance - who is having a steamy affair with the Head of Human Resources. 


You three are window cleaners. So you’re outside the window. You cannot hear anything inside the building, so please do not react to it.

I’ve forgotten who you’re supposed to be.

You’re a Deliveroo driver. The crowd formed around you and now it’s awkward for you to leave. 

You are the method actor Daniel Day-Lewis - and you’re researching a role for the upcoming Martin Scorsese film ‘Vending Machine Repair Man’. 

And you are the eldest child of the C.E.O. who is praying that this is the moment your father passes the business onto you - in a form of succession.

Good. I’m glad all that’s clear.

A quick recap - we have been assembled in the lobby to hear an announcement from the company C.E.O.

Let’s unpause there.

<LX: (2) BLUE STAGE WASH: OFF>

[HAND CARD TO CEO]

Please read the line.

[CEO READS CARD]
{C.E.O.: You’re all fired.}


Come on everybody, react! You’ve just lost your jobs!

No, Window Cleaners - not you!
You can’t hear through the window. And regardless, you’ll be fine - you’re employed by the building, not the company within it.

And you, Deliveroo driver, why are you upset? You’re still delivering food. 

And Daniel Day-Lewis. Great reaction. You’re going to win another Oscar!

Wait - what’s that noise outside? It sounds like a big crowd approaching?!

Let’s pause there.

Oh, wait. He’s the venue’s safety officer - waving to tell me that we can’t have any more people on the stage.

Oh well. To cut a long story short, I got the job. 

There you have it, the perfect job interview.

Thank you everybody. Now if you all could just...


<AV: GFX: BUIZ QUIZ>

[BUIZ QUIZ]

Buiz Quiz!!

Nobody move! 

This Buiz Quiz question will be answered by ... YOU!

[SELECT ON-STAGE VOLUNTEER]


Let’s find out if you is or isn’t a Buiz Quiz whizz.

In my module on financial modelling and balance sheets, which of the three components did I say was the most important?
a) Assets
b) Liabilities 
c) Equities?
Or d) The Libertines?

[PUNTER ANSWERS]

That is ... incorrect.


Now. I’ve just realised that yesterday, I re-ordered the seminar - meaning we haven’t actually covered the section on balance sheets yet.

So that question was rather unfair.

But then again - business IS unfair. 

Right then - Buiz Quiz is over. Off you all go everyone.

A round of applause for our volunteers!

[USHER VOLUNTEERS OFF]

Stay alert students because the next Buiz Quiz could happen any moment ... NOW!

It wasn’t at that moment.

## ROCKET LAUNCH - PART I ##
|SEQ09|

<LX: (2) STAGE SPOT: OFF>

<LX: (1) PODIUM: ON>

[STUMBLE ON BOLT]


Oh. What’s this on the floor? 

[HOLD UP A BOLT]

Did one of you drop a large bolt? No? Must’ve been left by a previous show - presumably a theatrical performance of ‘Frankenstein’.

Frankenstein wasn’t the name of the monster. He, of course, was called ‘Herman Munster’.

Now, as I hinted before, you are all very lucky to have joined me this evening.

As you know, all great businessmen worth their salt - or vinegar - have launched their own rocket:

Elon Musk has SpaceX.

<AV: ARCHIVE: SPACEX LAUNCH>

Jeff Bezos has Project Phallus.

<AV: ARCHIVE: BEZOS ROCKET>

And Alan Sugar has Amstrad Galactic.

<AV: GFX: AMSTRAD ROCKET>

Tonight I will be joining that elite group as I launch...

[ROCKET STING]

<AV: GFX: BUTTEROCKET LOGO>

Butterocket.

Bri-A-I-an? 

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN LISTENING>

Show live feed of my rocket.

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: Showing live feed now.>

BRI-A-I-AN: SHOWING LIVE FEED NOW.


That is a field on the outskirts of [TOWN] - and in less than one hour we will watch that rocket take off. Live.

This launch is symbolic of the most important lesson I can teach you tonight.

You mustn’t listen to those people who tell you it can’t be done - the naysayers, the haters ... the venture capitalists, the scientists, the environmentalists, your therapist, the police and the aviation authorities.

All you need is a dream.

<AV: MUSIC: ‘STAR TREK THEME’>

My whole business life has been leading up to this moment. Butterocket will send the Butterfield brand around the globe! Its payload? A satellite. And once it’s in orbit, that satellite will be capable of transmitting my new streaming service Buttflix directly into every single home across the planet - whether they want it or not.

Now, I’ll square with you: not EVERY business I’ve set up has been successful. One might even say that not ANY business I’ve set up has been successful.

However, Butterocket is different. I can feel it.

I’m so sure that Butterocket will be a success that I’ve sacrificed everything I own to fund this project. I’ve sold my office, my home, my car - plus I’ve sold all three of my kidneys.

Wait a minute - humans only have two kidneys. So what was the third organ I sold? Well, I seem to be managing without it.

What matters is - I’m so thrilled that you are all here to watch the launch of my new rocket with me. So. Let’s begin.

Bri-A-I-an? 

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN LISTENING>

Are air conditions appropriate?

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: The appropriate time to use hair conditioner is after shampoo.>

BRI-A-I-AN: THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO USE HAIR CONDITIONER IS AFTER SHAMPOO.

No! I’m asking about the weather! Is the weather suitable for take off?

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: The weather will be suitable for take off in approximately 45 minutes.>

BRI-A-I-AN: THE WEATHER WILL BE SUITABLE FOR TAKE OFF IN APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES.

Thank you! That’s great news. I can’t wait to watch the launch with you all tonight - that is, provided my webcam batteries don’t run out. Or that a sheep doesn’t wander in front of the lens.

<AV: GFX: A SHEEP WANDERS IN FRONT OF THE LENS>

Oh no! Shoo sheep! Shoo!

So sorry everybody, but I’ve just got to Uber to the launch site to get that sheep out of the way. 

Meanwhile, we’ll take a short intermission. For those of you on the Butterfield Diet, yes - this qualifies as an official fifteen-minute treat break! So feel free to indulge in any of the treats available in the foyer.

## NETWORKING - GLOSSARY ##
|SEQ13|

Now. Let’s continue with part B of the second bee: Networking.

<AV: SFX: NETWORKING STING>

[STING]

In one of my first-ever business meetings I barely understood a word anyone said. That's because - they were using business terminology. 


And also because - I was in Tokyo.

So tonight, I’m going to teach you all the business terms you need to know - in Brian’s Business Glossary.

<AV: SFX: BUSINESS GLOSSARY STING>

<AV: GLOSSARY BED>

[STING]

Before I begin, for those of you who don’t know what the words “business” and “glossary” mean...

<AV: GFX: “BUSINESS”>

‘Business’ means - the act of doing business.


<AV: GFX: “GLOSSARY”>

‘Glossary’ means - a vendor of gloss paint.

[BEAT BEGINS]

<LX: (7) DISCO: ON>

<AV: GFX: “PUSHING THE ENVELOPE”>

Pushing the envelope - the business way to get an item of post into a post box.

<AV: GFX: “INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY”>

Intellectual property - a house belonging to e.g. Stephen Fry.

<AV: GFX: “E-COMMERCE”>

E-commerce - commerce in Yorkshire.

<AV: GFX: “INVEST”>

Invest - how you dress when working from home.

<AV: GFX: “SYN-ERGY”>

Synergy - the energy you get from sinning.


<AV: GFX: “BALLPARK FIGURE”>

Ballpark figure - the physique of a baseball player.

<AV: GFX: “BRAINSTORM”>

Brainstorm - a banging in your head that occurs after you've filed for bankruptcy.

<AV: GFX: “MERGER”>

Merger - the agreement of two businesses to join forces, often brokered on a train.
Hence the phrase, “Merger on the Orient Express.”

Congratulations! 

<AV: DANCE MUSIC FADE>
<LX: (7) DISCO: OFF>

## RESILIENCE - HYPNOTHERAPY ##
|SEQ14|

Now it’s time to move onto an altogether more relaxing, more chilled out, more...

<AV: BUIZ QUIZ>

Buiz Quiz!!

Remain calm!

Although we are only 18% of the way through the seminar, this is the final Buiz Quiz.

And the final Buiz Quizer is ... you!

[SELECT PUNTER]

What’s your name?

[PUNTER RESPONDS]

Before I ask the final Buiz Quiz question...

Because the previous Buiz Quiz quizzers gave incorrect answers, if you get this final Buiz Quiz wrong, everyone here tonight will automatically fail the course. 

I’d HATE to be in your position right now. Such pressure.

Anyway, here goes...

One of the key skills in business is listening. Have you been listening to everything I’ve said?

So far tonight, I have spoken 7302 words.
Now it’s 7304 words.
Now it’s 7310 words.

But what was the one-thousandth word I said?

[PUNTER ANSWERS]


[PAUSE]

Wow! You really have been paying attention. 

Well done - because if you’d have got that wrong, everyone would have been forcefully ejected from the venue. A round of applause for [NAME]!

[APPLAUSE]


Now, it’s time to move onto the third bee - which is, of course, the fourth bee: Resilience.

<AV: GFX: INTRO FOR “RESILIENCE”>


[STING]

The key to being resilient - is confidence.

Now some people are born with confidence - for example, Boss Baby.

But others need to learn confidence. That’s why I am about to teach you how to become confident people.

Firstly, I need to identify who amongst you are extroverts, and who are introverts.

So, could all the introverts stand up?
And whoop.

Come on, wave your hands in the air! 
I can’t see you - or hear you!

Using my Brian Butterfield hypnotherapy techniques, I will subconsciously train all of you to be more confident.

If anyone is operating heavy machinery right now - please stop.

Breathe in.

Breathe out.

And breathe out.

Imagine you are in your happy place. Your special place. The place you feel safest.

A gentle breeze is blowing against your naked body.


Live in the moment. Absorb and appreciate every wonderful thing around you, utilising each and every one of your three senses.


The revitalising scent of fried chicken.
The babbling of youths as they inhale nitrous oxide.
The delicate flapping of a majestic one-winged pigeon.


This is your confident place.
This is where you can return to whenever you feel self-doubt.

So always remember:
You are brave.
You are strong. Mentally. You’re still physically weak.

You are bold. B-O-L-D.
And some of you are bald ... B-A-L-D.


But above all you ... are ... naked.
You are confident.

Now, slowly come back into the room.
And you can now finally breathe in.
Well done for holding your breath for that long.

And from hereon, I shall not be advising you on your breathing patterns.
Breathing is now your responsibility.

And you can now open your eyes.

Then let’s confidently move onto the fourth bee - which is the first bee: Invention.

[STING]

<AV: GFX: INTRO FOR “INVENTION”>


Invention is the lifeblood of any business - be it a piece of software, a new product or simply just an idea.

And right now, I’m going to give you the chance to pitch your brand new business ideas to me.


Your idea needs to be...
New.
Original.
And not a cheap imitation of something that’s gone before.

This is Brian’s Den!

<LX: (3) BLUE WASH: OFF>

Tonight I’ll be investing a serious amount of money in one of your businesses.
Not ten thousand. 
Not fifty thousand.
I will be investing one hundred thousand...
Butt Coins.
Which is my new cryptocurrency. 


It’s called a cryptocurrency because the computer I store it on is located in a church crypt.

Now, cryptocurrencies do tend to go up and down - so I don’t know quite how much tonight’s prize money is worth in British money right now. Let me check.

Bri-A-I-an?

How much is one hundred thousand Butt Coins in pounds sterling?

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: One hundred thousand Butt Coins is worth: eight pounds sterling.>

BRI-A-I-AN: ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUTT COINS IS WORTH: EIGHT POUNDS STERLING.


Oh! It’s gone up! 
That’s right! Somebody in this theatre WILL leave tonight with one hundred thousand Butt Coins! Life changing.

<AV: END BRI-A-I-AN>

Now, thank you all for messaging in your business ideas. There were so many. But THREE ideas, in particular, caught my business eye. Which is my right eye. I use my left eye for pleasure.

But looking for the positives, at least I now know where this bolt came from. I knew I shouldn’t have removed it.


Sorry, everyone. It is very disappointing to have to postpone the launch - but you simply can’t take risks when it comes to launching metallic tubes filled with highly flammable jet fuel.

[EMOTIONAL PAUSE]

Well that’s another business up in flames.

You know, even in my lowest moments, my motto has always been “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try ... try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try ... try, try, try again.”

Well I tried that.
And let’s be honest - I haven’t succeeded once.


Maybe it’s finally time to admit - I’m a terrible businessman.

I’m sorry everyone.
I shouldn’t be standing up here on this stage.


Because ... who am I to run a seminar?
Who am I to tell you how to be successful?
What’s the point of even trying?
What’s the point of anything?
Life’s just a series of business failures - and then you die.

Right, what’s the last slide?

[“BEE POSITIVE” SLIDE]

<AV: GFX: INTRO FOR “BE POSITIVE”>

That’s easy for you to say Powerpoint slide.

How can I be positive when I’ve failed in all my businesses?
I’ve failed all of you students.
I’ve failed to make an A.I. that can even understand me.
Stupid Bri-A-I-an.

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN SIGNAL FLASHES UP>


I don’t even know the definition of a successful businessman.

<AV: BRI-A-I-AN: A successful businessman is someone who builds a loyal consumer base willing to exchange money for goods or services.>

BRI-A-I-AN: A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN IS SOMEONE WHO BUILDS A LOYAL CONSUMER BASE WILLING TO EXCHANGE MONEY FOR GOODS OR SERVICES.

Well there you go.
I can’t even do that.

I’m sorry to you all for wasting your money.
In exchange for my services.

Wait...!

I DO have a loyal consumer base. You!

You chose to waste your money in exchange for my services. And goods, if you buy merchandise in the foyer.
 
This simply wouldn’t have happened without you.

So by Bri-A-I-an’s definition, I AM a successful businessman. 

For the first time in my life - I have succeeded. Emotionally. Obviously not financially.

And that tiny taste of success makes me all the more determined.

Because I’m not just doing this for me, I’m doing it for you.


So I promise to never give up.
I promise I’ll always keep trying.

Which just goes to show the power of ... perminstance.

Before I go on, I’d just like to point out - this is NOT an encore.
This is simply a part of the show I forgot to do.

After you’ve finished with the business of business - why not come down to the Butterfield Karaoke Bar!

And our selection of tracks is bigger than ever - because I’ve recently purchased nearly ten new songs.

My VCDs were imported directly from the home of karaoke - which unfortunately means the lyrics were in Japanese.


But don’t worry! I’ve translated them BACK into English - using Bri-A-I-an.

Please join in with me, as I sing along to this classic by Miss Whitney Houston.

And all the streets we walk along are bendy,
And all the lights along the way cause blindness.
There are many things that I would like to say to you,

Come on everybody - sing along!

You’re going to be the one who saves me,
And after all,
You’re my stunning fence.

Beautiful singing! That brings us to the end of the seminar.

Have a safe journey home - although I should warn you that, due to an unexpected astronautical incident in the local area, all public transport - and indeed all roads and pavements across TOWN - are out of action.

So instead, do stick around as I’ll be out in the bar shortly to sign your degree certificates and take photos.

Thank you - you’ve been a wonderful audience TOWN! Good night!

I got seven Mac 11s, about eight 38's,
Nine 9s, ten Mac 10s, the shits never ends.

You can't touch my riches,
even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches.

Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht,
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks.

That's how I got the weed spot,
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread.

Little Gotti got the shotty to your body,
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas.

I tote guns, I make number runs,
I give MCs the runs drippin'.

When I throw my clip in the AK,
I slay,
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K!
